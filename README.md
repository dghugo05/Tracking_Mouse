# Tracking Mouse - RatonAereo
## Description
"RatonAereo" is a Python-based project focused on mouse tracking and automation. The primary goal of this project is to provide an accessible way to interact with graphical user interfaces through automatic mouse movements and clicks. 
It leverages machine learning and image processing techniques to track user gestures and translate them into on-screen actions. This project also includes functionality to record video of the screen while the mouse is being controlled.

## Features
路 Mouse Tracking: The application can track and simulate mouse movement, clicks, and drags based on predefined gestures.
路 Gesture Recognition: Using computer vision to identify specific hand gestures via webcam input.
路 Video Recording: The program can record the screen while the user interacts with applications, saving the output in a video file format.
路 User-Friendly Interface: Designed to work seamlessly with existing applications on the system. It does not require complex configurations.
